# Ace-Of-Spades-Club
In this project, I used flexbox to design and build the layout for a poker club's homepage while also focusing on responsiveness.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

One of the first websites that I built from scratch using HTML and CSS. Focus was on the effective use of media queries to create a responsive web page based on window size. 

## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to make a header/navigation bar become responsive by adjusting the arrangement of the elements (logo, nav links) to look more presentable as the screen size gets smaller.
